<h1>Privacy&nbsp;Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: 12 June 2025</strong></p>

<p>
  Sugoi Shimeji (“<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”, “<strong>the
  Extension</strong>”) respects your privacy. This page describes what data is
  collected when you visit <code>sugoishimeji.github.io</code> (“<strong>the
  Site</strong>”) or use the Sugoi Shimeji Chrome/Firefox extension, how that
  data is used, and the choices you have.
</p>

<h2>1. Data we <em>do not</em> collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We do <strong>not</strong> ask for or store your name, e-mail, address,
      phone number, or payment details.</li>
  <li>No keystrokes, browsing history, or form contents ever leave your device.</li>
  <li>The Extension’s settings are saved locally using Chrome’s
      <code>chrome.storage</code> API and are <em>never</em> transmitted to our
      servers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Data collected automatically</h2>
<p>
  Like most websites, the Site collects limited, pseudonymous information that
  your browser sends automatically:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>IP address and approximate geolocation</li>
  <li>Browser &amp; device type</li>
  <li>Referring URL and pages viewed</li>
  <li>Date / time of visit</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is used solely for aggregated traffic analytics, security
  (e.g. blocking abuse) and to comply with legal obligations.</p>

<h2>3. Advertising &amp; cookies</h2>
<p>
  The Extension shows a small banner ad inside its popup. Ads are provided by
  <a href="https://ad-maven.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank"
     rel="noopener">AdMaven</a> (“<strong>AdMaven</strong>”), an independent ad
  network that acts as an <em>independent data controller</em>. When an ad is
  displayed, AdMaven may:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set or read cookies and local-storage identifiers for
      frequency-capping & analytics</li>
  <li>Log your IP address, user-agent, and ad interaction events</li>
</ul>
<p>
  AdMaven’s practices are governed by their own
  <a href="https://ad-maven.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank"
     rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<h3>Managing cookies / opting out</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>On the Site:</strong> the cookie banner shown to EU/UK visitors
      lets you accept or decline non-essential cookies.</li>
  <li><strong>In the Extension:</strong> open the Settings panel and toggle
      “Hide ads” to disable the ad iframe completely. Your preference is stored
      locally and sent nowhere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Legal bases for processing</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for cookies and personalised ads where required
      (e.g. EU, UK).</li>
  <li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong> – to protect our service from abuse
      and measure anonymous traffic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Your rights</h2>
<p>If you are in the EEA/UK, you have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict
  or object to processing, and to data portability.  
  California residents have the right to know, delete, and opt-out of “selling
  or sharing” personal data under the CCPA/CPRA.</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, e-mail us at
  <a href="mailto:austinthemichaud@gmail.com">austinthemichaud@gmail.com</a>.
  We may ask for additional information to verify your identity.</p>

<h2>6. Data retention</h2>
<p>
  Site server logs are kept for no more than 30 days unless we are investigating
  abuse. AdMaven retains ad logs as described in their policy.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s privacy</h2>
<p>
  Sugoi Shimeji is not directed at children under 13 and we do not knowingly
  collect data from them. If you believe a child has provided us personal
  information, please contact us so we can delete it.
</p>

<h2>8. International transfers</h2>
<p>
  We are based in Mexico; data may be processed on servers located in other
  countries with adequate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.
</p>

<h2>9. Third-party links</h2>
<p>
  The Site may link to external pages (e.g. GitHub, Twitter). We are not
  responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.
</p>

<h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Material changes will be
  announced on the Site and by bumping the “Last updated” date above.
